Blast+ is included on Ubuntu releases.

For other releases it will need to be built or downloaded from NCBI.

It would not build cleanly on Ubuntu, untried as of yet on other platforms.

Note that blast+ includes an incompatible version of rpsblast. The Ubuntu
packaging installs that version as rpsblast+ which source installs should
emulate.
