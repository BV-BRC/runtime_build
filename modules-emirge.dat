as it seems Folker thinks (and he told other people) that Emirge is
already in KBase, but to my knowledge it is not. Therefore I'd prefer to
put it in KBase now as quickly as possible.. ;-)
What would be the fastest/easiest way I can get Emirge into the
bootstrap ? Would you put it in there or should I do it myself ?

download source:

dependencies (with example how to install):

- apt-get install python-biopython cython
- pip install pysam scipy numpy
- usearch version >= 6.0.203
- bowtie
- samtools

Most of the requirements should already be fulfilled, but I am not
exactly sure.


thanks
